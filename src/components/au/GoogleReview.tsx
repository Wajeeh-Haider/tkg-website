The service was easy to book and they had a really good pre-attendance questionnaire that asked about preferences during the euthenasia process.'

They genuinely cared for my fur baby and made the experience of saying goodbye in my home a warm and loving experience. Such an amazing eye for detail too for both my fur baby and myself. Big shout out and heartfelt thank you to Aoibhean, Andrea and Tom. Highly highly recommend the team.'

She made it a lot easier for us, explained how he was feeling and what would happen. It was a nice way to go, on his bed with his family around. Thank you'

When our family came to the time of saying goodbye to our beautiful Elly, we had a beautiful but solemn time brought about by the caring assistance of Louise. I cannot thank the team enough for their care.'

        text: 'After a heartbreaking decision on Christmas Eve, we had to make a painful decision to say goodbye to our beautiful Kira who was 14 years and 9 months old. The kindest Goodbye was recommended by 2 of my closest friends who had used the service. Dr Elbaali Was amazing, he was caring and reassured me that it was her time, which made me feel at ease. He took the time to explain everything to us. He was so gentle with her when he picked her up to take her away. The service was amazing and our beloved Kira was returned back home after a few short weeks Thank you to the team at The Kindest Goodbye'

Dr. Chad was exceptionally patient, gentle, and compassionate - not only with our beloved Maxy but with our entire family throughout the process. It was clear that Maxy felt comfortable with him, which made our goodbye even more meaningful. The team was also incredibly responsive to all of our questions, and we couldnâ€™t be more grateful for the beautiful service they provided.'
